# comparisons_between_sort_algorithms_in_time
## Sorting is one of the most fundamental algorithmic problems within computer science. It has been claimed that as many as 25% of all CPU cycles are spent sorting, which provides a lot of incentive for further study and optimization of sorting. The wide variety of algorithms gives us a lot of richness to explore, especially when considering the tradeoffs offered in terms of efficiency, operation mix, code complexity, best/worst case inputs, and so on. 
### I implemented a function that generates a random array for a given size, then I sort this array with the sort algorithms implemented and print the time taken.
## Algorithms implemented:
1. ### Quick Sort.
2. ### Merge Sort.
3. ### Heap Sort.
4. ### Insertion Sort.
5. ### Selection Sort.
